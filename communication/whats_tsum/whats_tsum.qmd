## Overview

This document demonstrates how to present method walkthroughs using **Quarto**
while avoiding expensive recomputation during rendering.

Heavy numerical examples are **precomputed externally** and only *loaded* here.

---

## Lightweight sanity check (runs instantly)

```{python}
import numpy as np
np.mean([1, 2, 3])
```

---

## Heavy example (precomputed)

The following results are assumed to be generated by an external script
(e.g. `scripts/run_heavy_demo.py`).

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_parquet("results/demo1_summary.parquet")
df
```

![](results/fig_roc.png){width=80%}

---

## How to reproduce the heavy results

Run the following **once** (outside Quarto):

```bash
python scripts/run_heavy_demo.py
```

Then re-render this document:

```bash
quarto render
```

---

## Notes

- `freeze: auto` prevents re-execution unless this file changes
- heavy computations should live in scripts, not in this document
- results should be saved as small tables or figures
